In Glitch, please run the project in a new window as this app requires openning a new page (SimpleLogin or Facebook)
and this doesn't work inside the "Next to The Code" view in Glitch.

If you want to remix your own example, please make sure to fill up the `.env` file according to the `.env.example`.

Having fun with Social Login!
